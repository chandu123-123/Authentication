      <h1 className="font-bold text-center text-4xl mt-5">Authentication</h1>
      <p className="text-center mt-4">Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of an entity, typically a user or system, to ensure they are who they claim to be before granting access to resources or functionalities. It establishes trust and security within applications or systems by validating credentials such as usernames, passwords, tokens, or other forms of identification. Through authentication mechanisms, users prove their identity, often using various factors like knowledge (e.g., passwords), possession (e.g., cryptographic keys), or inherent traits (e.g., biometrics). Robust authentication systems employ secure practices, including encryption, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and regularly updated credentials, to safeguard against unauthorized access, data breaches, and protect sensitive information. Authentication is a fundamental component of secure systems, forming the foundation for authorization and access control, ensuring that only authorized users gain entry to protected resources or functionalities.
